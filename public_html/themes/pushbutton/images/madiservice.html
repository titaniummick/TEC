<h1>Cataract</h1>
<div class="knowcont"><p>Cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye which keeps light and images from reaching the retina. It can be the reason that sharp image become blurred or seeing things at night is more difficult. It may be why eyeglasses or contact lenses that used to help you read, or do other simple tasks, no longer seem to help.</p>

<p>Cataract is the leading cause of visual loss in adults age 55 and older. By age 75, almost everyone has a cataract. In addition to aging, other causes of cataracts include: medical problems, such as diabetes, injury to the eye, medication such as steroids, long term unprotected exposure to sunlight. However, cataracts are highly treatable, and through advances in both cataract surgery and <a href="#">intraocular</a> lenses, more people are experiencing full restoration of their vision than ever </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="knowcont">
<h3>One of the Safest and most Successful Procedures Performed Today</h3>
<div class="knowcontlft"><img src="images/one-co.jpg" alt="" /><p>Intraocular Lens Master</p></div>
<div class="knowcontright"> <p><strong>Cataract surgery</strong> is a simple outpatient procedure. You’ll spend a few hour at the site. Eye drops to dilate your pupil and numb your eye will be given several times before the procedure. </p>
<p><strong>Phacoemulsification</strong> is the most advanced and most commonly used technique. It requires a very small incision 2.2 millimeter on the side of the cornea. The surgeon may use a device or an ultrasonic instrument that breaks up and gently removes your cloudy lens. Once the clouded lens has been removes, artificial intraocular lens will be replaced. <a href="#">The entire procedure usually lasts between 15 and 25 minutes.</a> Since the incision is <a href="#">small, no stitch</a> or eye pad is needed, and the eye heals <a href="#">rapidly</a>. Patients may experience little to no pain and can usually return to their normal activities the following day. </p>

<div class="knowcontright"> <p><strong>The blue light filter lens filters both UV and blue light. It is made of patented acrylic material developed specifically for the eye</strong> <p>
<ol>
<li>Monofocal IOL  monofocal  lenses are the most frequently implanted in the world with good clinical result. After implant the patient can see far vision well, but require reading glasses.
</li>
<li>Multifocal IOL For patients with cataracts and presbyopia there is the ACRYSOF® RESTOR® lens, which corrects for both conditions at the same time, eliminating the need for spectacles after surgery in most patients. Clinical trials showed that over 80 percent of patients receiving this lens never required glasses for any task following surgery
</li>
<li>Toric IOL For patients with cataracts and astigmatism there is the ACRYSOF® Toric lens, which corrects for both conditions simultaneously.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>


<div class="knowcont">
<h3>Preparing before cataract surgery</h3>
<p>To help maintain a clean surgical environment, you should wash your hair and face on the day prior of the surgery or the day of surgery. Wear clean, comfortable clothes. The entire process should last about two to three hours. The actual procedure usually takes just 15 to 20 minutes per eye. </p>
</div>

<div class="history" style="margin-top:15px;">
<h1>Post Operative Care</h1>
<ul>
<li>Follow instruction at home with eyedrop and medications</li>
<li>See physician the next day or by appointment</li>
<li>Do not rub or let water get into the operative eye for 1 week</li>
<li>Clean your face with wet cloth. Shampoo your hair 1 week after surgery or have it done without getting water in your eye</li>
<li>Avoid dust or dirty particles from getting in your eye.   Wear sunglasses when exposure to sunlight outdoor</li>
</ul>

<h1>What is…… LASIK ?</h1>
<div class="laslfy "><img src="images/lasik2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<div class="lasright">
<p>Laser assisted in situ keratomileusis, or LASIK, is an outpatient surgical procedure that treats myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and astigmatism. LASIK uses a microkeratome and a laser to reshape the cornea (the clear covering of the eye) to improve the way the eye focuses light rays on to the retina.</p>
<p>LASIK may decrease your dependence on glasses and contact lens or, in some cases, allow you to do without them entirely.
Most people who have this procedure are corrected to better than 20/40 vision and many people achieve 20/20 vision, or 20/10 vision</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="history" style="margin-top:15px;">
<h1>Am I ……… a good candidate for LASIK ?</h1>
<div class="laslfy "><img src="images/lasi.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<div class="lasright">
<p>People who want to minimize their dependence on glasses or contact lenses make good candidates for LASIK. Lifestyle, hobbies, and amount of correction needed are all factors that may determine whether you are a good candidate.
The ideal candidate for LASIK is over 18 years of age, not pregnant, and free of any eye disease. You are not taking medications with ocular side effect (for example acutane, cordarone). You should not have had a change in your prescription in the last year, and should have a refractive error within the range of correction for LASIK. You must also be willing to accept the potential risks, complications and side effects.</p>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="tablepaddign"><h2>Before</h2>
	<p>Before the treatment, your physician will conduct a detailed examination to determine if your eyes are healthy and suitable for the treatment. If you wear contact lenses, you should stop wearing them at least a few weeks before the actual treatment. depending on the type of contact lens that you are wearing.</p>	</td>
    <td valign="top" class="tablepaddign1"><h2><span>Preparation</span></h2>
	<p>Your physician will conduct and extensive examination of your eye before the laser treatment in order to precisely determine its health, come al thickness and the degree of your visual defect. Once the examination is completed on the day of treatment, you will lie down on the laser bed. The physician will then apply eye drops to numb your eye.</p>	</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="tablepaddign12">
	<h2><span>Treatment</span></h2>
	<p>In the first step of the procefure, the physician creates a thin flap in the upper layer of your cornea. During this time your sight will be briefly interrupted due to increased ocular pressure in your eye. Then the flap is carefully folded back to expose the lower corneal layer. At this point you will be aboe to see, but everything will be blurry.</p>

<p>For the next step, the physician will ask you to concentrate your sight on a green light. Then the actual laser treatment begins. Due to the high speed of the laser system, the average treatment will only take a few seconds.</p>

<p>Once the laser treatment is finished, the flap is returned to its original position where it completely adheres and works like a natural band-aid. Your eye will then receive antibiotic eye drops to prevent infections. The treatment is now fully completed.</p></td>
    <td valign="top" class="tablepaddign13">
	<h2>After</h2>
	<p>You will already be able to see your surroundings with improved visual acuity, but for a few hours after the treatment your eye may itch or burn and you experience sensitivity to light.

<h1>What happens before surgery?</h1>
<p>Your ophthalmologist will perform a thorough eye exam to measure your prescription and check for any abnormalities that might affect the procedure. Your doctor will check your eyes for unusual dryness, which could cause dry eye symptoms post-operatively, or unusually large pupils, which could affect night or low-light vision.</p>
</div>

<span class="imgdav pad"><img src="images/alergy.jpg" alt="" /></span>
<div class="history lasikmarg" style="font-size:12px;">
<h1>What happens after surgery?</h1>
<p>A see-through shield protects the eye for the first night. It is normal for the eye to burn or feel scratchy. This usually disappears in a few hours. Plan on going home and taking a nap or just relaxing after the procedure. You will be given eyedrops to help heal and alleviate dryness. Healing after LASIK is usually less uncomfortable than with other methods of refractive surgery because the laser removes tissue from the inside of the cornea and not the more sensitive corneal surface.</p>
</div>


<div class="history lasikmarg" style="font-size:12px;">
<h1>Risks, Complications and Side Effects</h1>
<p>LASIK, like any surgery, has risks and complications that should be carefully considered. LASIK can sometimes result in undercorrection or overcorrection. Fortunately, these problems can often be improved with glasses, contact lenses, or an additional laser surgery. Although rare, overcorrection may be permanent.<br />
  <strong>Most complications can be treated without any loss of vision</strong>. There is extremely small chance, that your vision will not be as good after the surgery as before, even with glasses or contacts. This is called a loss of best corrected vision.<br />
  Some people experience temporary side effects after LASIK. These include:<br />
  discomfort or pain, hazy or blurry vision, scratchiness, dryness, haloes or starbursts around lights, Light sensitivity and small pink or red patches on the white of the eye<br />
  Almost everyone experiences some dryness in the eyes and fluctuating vision during the day. These symptoms usually fade within one month, although some people will continue to have symptoms for a longer period of time.<br />

<h1>Glaucoma</h1>

<div class="knowcont"> <img src="images/glu.jpg" alt="" align="left" style="margin-right:15px;" />
  <p>Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that gradually cause the decrease in eyesight without warning. Vision loss is caused by damage to the optic nerve. Experts estimate that half of the people affected by glaucoma may not know they have it. Although IOP(intraocular pressure) is clearly a risk factor of optic nerve damage, other factors must also be involved because even people with “normal” levels of pressure can experience vision loss from glaucoma.</p>
<p>There is no cure for primary open angle glaucoma—yet. However, medication or surgery can slow or prevent further vision loss. The appropriate treatment depends upon the type of glaucoma among other factors. Early detection is vital to stopping the progress of the disease.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="glaucoma lasikmarg">
<h2>Are You at Risk For Glaucoma?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Everyone is at risk for glaucoma. However, certain groups are at higher risk than others 
People age over 60 are six times more likely to get glaucoma.</li>
<li>Family members with glaucoma increases risk of glaucoma four to nine times. </li>
<li>Asians  People of Asian descent appear to be at some risk for angle closure glaucoma.</li>
<li>Steroid Users.  40% increase in the incidence of ocular hypertension and open angle glaucoma in adults who require approximately 14 to 35 puffs of steroid inhaler to control severe asthma.</li>
<li>History of eye injury.  It is important to have your eyes examined regularly. Anyone with high risk factors, should be tested every year or two after age 35.</li>

<div class="glaucoma_inerright">
  <h5>Tonometry</h5>
  <p>The tonometry test measures the inner pressure of the eye. Your intraocular eye pressure (IOP) is important to determining your risk for glaucoma. If you have high IOP, careful management of your eye pressure with medications can help prevent vision loss.</p>  
  <h5>Ophthalmoscopy</h5>
  <p>Ophthalmoscopy is used to examine the inside of the eye, especially the optic nerve. This helps the doctor look at the shape and color of the optic nerve.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="glaucoma_iner">
<h5>Visual field test</h5>
<p>During this test, you will be asked to look straight ahead and then indicate when a moving light passes your peripheral (or side) vision. This helps draw a “map” of your vision. </p>
</div>

<div class="glaucoma_iner">
<h5>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)</h5>
<p>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is new technique of optic nerve image scanning. The OCT machine can create a contour map of the optic nerve, optic cup and measure the retinal nerve fiber thickness. This machine can detect loss of optic nerve fibers. </p>
</div>

<div class="glaucoma_iner">
<div class="glaucoma_inerleft"><img src="images/glu1.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></div>
<div class="glaucoma_inerright">
  <h5>Pachymetry</h5>
  <p>Pachymetry test is a simple, quick, painless test to measure the thickness of your cornea. With this measurement, your doctor can better understand your IOP reading, and develop a treatment plan that is right for your condition.</p>  
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div class="history lasikmarg">
<h1>Treatment at Thai Eye Center</h1>
<div class="glaucoma_iner">
<h5>Eyedrops </h5>
<p>Glaucoma treatment often starts with medicated eyedrops. Be sure to use the drops exactly as prescribed and follow up regularly as assigned.</p>
</div>

<div class="glaucoma_iner">
<h5>Oral medications</h5>
<p>If eyedrops alone don't bring your eye pressure down to the desired level, your doctor may also prescribe an oral medication. Doctors commonly prescribe carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide (Diamox), for glaucoma. Take these pills with meals to reduce side effects. Add bananas and apple juice to your diet to minimize the potassium loss caused by these medications.</p>
